# IOT-in-Local-Server
Arduino code to send dht data to Local server.
In this project you will need an Arduino Uno Board, Esp8266, Dht sensor and jumper wires.
Replace your Wifi ID and Password in the code.
Write the code in the Esp8266 Sensor using Arduino Uno.
After executing the code copy and paste the IP shown in the monitor into the browser.
You will find the output in the browser.
Connections with the Esp8266 and Dht sensor.
DHT11 sensor (+) pin will be connected to 3.3V
DHT11 sensor (-) pin will be connected to GND pin
Output of DHT11 sensor is connected to GPIO pin of ESP8266.
